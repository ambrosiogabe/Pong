# Pong
Hello World! This is by far the simplest game you will ever make. I have made several different versions, and may 
get around to uploading those at some point (I know you can't wait for my seizure pong version :). The coding of this 
game was very simple. It uses Java Swing and AWT, as you can see most of my other projects use. 

# Why Java?
I know a lot of people are probably like why the heck does he use Java for game creation? The simple answer is that I was 
a poor misguided soul disillusioned by fantasies of a multi-billion dollar game created in Java... Namely, Minecraft. I
have since realized that this is not the mainstream choice of language for game developers and I am now creating more stuff
in Unreal and Unity using C# and C++. 

But, haters aside, I think you should just code in whichever language you feel comfortable with. The game mechanics never
change, so if you like a language, go for it.

# To run
Go to the folder under bin. Also make sure you have Java installed and JAVA_HOME set in your environment variables. Then run:
```
java main.Main
 ```
 and play to your heart's content.
